# Admin Dashboard
This repository contains an admin dashboard built using HTML and CSS. The dashboard is designed to be responsive to various screen sizes, although it still needs mobile optimization.

# Features

* A header section that includes a search input, buttons, and a welcome message
* A navigation section on the left side of the screen that uses icons in a column
* A section with modern cards that show current projects, including text and icons

# Usage
To use this dashboard, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. You can also modify the HTML and CSS files to customize the dashboard to your needs.

# Mobile Optimization
While the dashboard is responsive to different screen sizes, it still needs some optimization for mobile devices.
